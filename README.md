# School District Analysis

### Overview of Project
The school board notified my supervisors that there was evidence of acedemic dishonesty; mainly in reading and math scores for the ninth graders of Thomas High School. Because of this, I was tasked with redoing the school district analysis. This time I was to replace all Thomas High School 9th grader's math and reading scores with Nan and see how it affects our data and overall analysis.

### Results
These were the reults of Thomas High School before removing the 9th graders overall grades (in order of math, reading, and last Overall)
> Thomas High School	Charter 	66.911315	  69.663609	  65.076453

And this is after removing the 9th graders:
> Thomas High School   90.630324   97.018739   90.630324

As you can see, removing the 9th graders made the overall averages of math, reading, and Overall go up to the 90% range. It also shows that Thomas High School has better averages then other schools with no 9th graders.

### Summary
The four biggest changes achieved by redo-ing the school district analysis are that Thomas High School has way better averages without 9th graders, Charter schools tend to have higher scores than district schools in math and reading, the smaller the school makes you more likely to get better scores in math and reading, and the school with the highest budget does not have the best test grades
